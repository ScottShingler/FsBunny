=======

FsBunny implements a streaming API over RabbitMQ optimized for implementation of event-driven systems.

The core idea is that while there are many streams carrying many messages using many serializers, each stream is dedicated to a single type of message serialized using certain serializer. 

It works under the assumptions that:

- We never want to lose a message
- The exchange + topic tells us the message type (as well as serialization format)
- The consumer is long-lived and handles only one type of message
- The consumer decides when to pull the next message of a queue
- The publishers can be long- or short-lived and address any topic
- We have multiple serialization formats and may want to add new ones easily

These assumptions may not be suitable in all scenarios, but they map extremely well to event-driven processing.
